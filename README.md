# Python-DC-Motor-Control-Library-for-Raspberry-Pi

Welcome to the DC Motor Control Library designed for the Raspberry Pi 4 utilizing Python. This library provides robust functionality for controlling DC motors using Pulse Width Modulation (PWM), and is tailored for use with drivers such as the L298N motor driver. To successfully use this library, you'll need to grasp the following concepts and have a basic understanding of control systems.

# Introductory concepts

PID Control: The library incorporates PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) control techniques to optimize motor performance. PID controllers use feedback from encoders to adjust motor commands dynamically, ensuring stable and accurate motor control, particularly under varying load conditions.

Pulse Width Modulation (PWM): PWM is an effective way to control motor speed and direction by varying the width of the pulses, enabling precise adjustments in motor operations.

Interrupts: Handling real-time events accurately is crucial in motor control. This library uses interrupts to promptly manage tasks like speed monitoring and direction changes, enhancing overall system responsiveness.

DC Motor with Encoder: Encoders provide necessary feedback for accurate control over motor position and speed, which is indispensable for closed-loop control systems.


# Features

Port Mapping and Instantiation: The library provides a class where you can instantiate port mappings, allowing for customized configuration aligned with your specific hardware setup.

Control Methods: Utilize intuitive control methods such as .move(degrees) to specify precise motor movements, enhancing ease of use in motor management tasks.

PID Parameters Customization: The library offers flexibility in defining PID control parameters, enabling you to fine-tune the motor control system tailored to your project's requirements.
